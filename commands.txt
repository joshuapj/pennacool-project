Summary of Changes Made to SQL Setup:

1. Changed the foreign key in the school table to use the id in the user table. this had to be done after
   the user table was created.


Some things I noted:
   -  to create a school, you need a principal, but you can't just create a principal for a new school that doesnt
      exist

   -  i was about to change the school assosciated with a principal when creating a school, but then i realized
      that just because one school has one principal, one user can be the principal of multiple schools.

   -  this makes it kinda hard to create a new school. to make a new school, you'd first have to make a new user,
      assign them as a teacher to an exisiting school
